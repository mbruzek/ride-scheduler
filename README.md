# Ride Scheduler

An automated solution for scheduling group rides.

## Problem
The local bicycle club has weekly rides on Monday and Wednesday night. Each
day before the ride a human looks up the wind direction, wind speed,
temperature and sunset time to schedule the rides. Scheduling the weekly group
rides is a manual task that takes a human time to complete each week.

## Solution
Create an automated script that can gather the on-line information,
compute the route and post the ride.

## Information

**Requirements**: Must be easier than performing the tasks manually.

**Budget**: Zero dollars.
